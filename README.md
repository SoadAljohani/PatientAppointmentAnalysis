## Project Objective
This project aim to analyze the patients' appointments dataset in order to find the factors that could cause the patients to attend or miss their appointments. 
## Summary
Our investigation and analysis concluded that the only factor that can affect the appointment attendance is age, the other factors such as the chronic diseases, having a scholarship, receiving notification, and the interval between the appointment and its booking are not significant factors. So, we have to collect more variables and data to find the real reason behind the absenteeism
